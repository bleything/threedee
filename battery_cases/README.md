Battery Cases
================================================================================

These battery cases are based on [Walter Hsiao]'s [customizable design] on
Thingiverse. They were customized with the following settings:

* all case tops are 15mm tall
* the AA cases are 35.5mm tall
* the AAA cases are 29.5mm tall
* the 8 AA case is 4 columns x 2 rows
* the 4 AAA case is 2 columns x 2 rows
* the 2 AAA case is 2 columns x 1 row

All other settings were left at defaults.

The [bottoms.stl] file contains all three case bottoms and was assembled by
[bottoms.scad].

The [tops.stl] file contains all three case tops and was assembled by
[tops.scad].
